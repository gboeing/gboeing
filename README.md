I am an Assistant Professor in the University of Southern California's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, the Director of USC's Urban Data Lab, and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. I received my PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of California, Berkeley. My research and teaching focus on urban data science and spatial networks. My work has been shortlisted by the Information Is Beautiful Awards and the NetSci Visualization Awards, and covered by numerous media outlets including The Economist, The Guardian, The Atlantic, and The Washington Post. I developed and maintain the OSMnx street network modeling software and have served as a consultant for several planning, policymaking, and public health organizations.
