I am an Associate Professor in USC's Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis, the Director of USC's [Urban Data Lab](https://geoffboeing.com/lab/), and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.

My research and teaching focus on geospatial data science, urban networks, and information landscapes. My work has been shortlisted by the Information Is Beautiful Awards and the NetSci Visualization Awards, and covered by numerous media outlets including _The Economist_, _The Guardian_, _The Atlantic_, and _The Washington Post_. I developed and maintain the [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) street network modeling software and have served as a consultant for several planning, policymaking, and public health organizations.
